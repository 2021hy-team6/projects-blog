The objective of the project is to portray the sentiment of a conversation,
while providing a transcription of the audio - while the software transcribes the conversation, 
the application will estimate the speakers' underlying emotion, or sentiment.

An example of where it could be used is a group meeting. The converstion would be transcribed,
and the sentiment classified per the speaker's spoken words. The transcribed texts and result
of sentiment analysis would be available in a text format after the meeting is over, but also
available on the screen in real-time.
