|An object to the camera in real-time|**OpenCV, TACO**|**Recycling Statistics**|Feedback to the user which category the object has to be recycled|


## Introduction

### Objectives

The purpose of our project is to design an artificial intelligence application that can help people separate recycling in real-time. If you present the application's linked camera with an object, it should return some feedback on how to recycle it.

### Applications

An example of an application for this would be to place it in a recycling area, to help reduce confusion on certain recyclable objects, as well as presenting some educational benefit. In addition, statistics would be supported by the application, allowing users to see the overall recycling load.
