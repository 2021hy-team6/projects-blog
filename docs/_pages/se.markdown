**Objectives**

The purpose of our project is to design an artificial intelligence model that helps people separate recycling in real time. If you show the camera the trash to recycle in real time, it tells you how to recycle it.

**Applications**

This model can be placed in recycling grounds used by many people, including apartments, share houses, and companies. If many people throw away trash, it can cause confusion because the garbage is not properly classified.
Our model can prevent those confusion and present an accurate recycling method for the environment.
